# Ensuring Reproducibility of complex data analytic projects

Why should you care about reproducibility? In this workshop (2h), I will give you the answer and discuss the nuts and bolts of reproducibility.
Spoiler: it is about getting the same results from the same analysis on the same data set.
We discuss what can go wrong when trying to achieve reproducibility and derive some best practices to avoid common pitfalls.
In the second half of the workshop, you'll have a chance to get your hands dirty with some practical examples in R using RStudio Cloud.
