# Ensuring Reproducibility of complex data analytic projects

I will discuss in this workshop (2h) what reproducibility is, why you should care about it and how you can achieve it.
Spoiler: getting the same results from the same data set, because you will be more productive, just copy effective best practices from software engineering.
If you want to we'll get our hands dirty using R in [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud), but bystanders are also very welcome.
