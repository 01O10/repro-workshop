## Getting Started

Hi there, great that you made it!

It is useful to keep the [slides open alongside](https://aaronpeikert.github.io/repro-workshop/presentation.html#1) (who likes typing links?).

Lets get started by creating an account on Github and RStudio Cloud (login below, if you already have one).

```{r child="snippets/signup.Rmd"}
```

```{r child="snippets/signin.Rmd"}
```

## RStudio Cloud

Now that you have acces to RStudio Cloud, open the project:
