# Dynamic Documents {-}

```{r}
reprodude2 <- generate_reprodudes(links$reprodudes$two,
                                  "ReproDude",
                                  "Hey, I'm your ReproDude for this chapter. If you have any questions click on me and we can talk!")

cat(reprodude2)

```
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

## What do I see before me? {-}
First of all:

<span style="color:green"> Look around, become comfortable. Then, locate the files pane.</span>

Do you feel comfortable yet? Yes? Then let's move on. 
If not, take as much time as you need and move on as soon as you want, I have no more Appointments today.

## Best practices? {-}

To give you a sense of how reproducibility can be increased, i will show you some best practices:

<span style="color:green"> Open the R folder.</span>

You should now see three different R files.

<span style="color:green"> Click on the file </span><span style="color:orange">R/prepare_games.R </span>

Now try to understand the code. 
Which of these do you already do? 
What could you improve?
You want to see more? 
Because it's you (same thing but more complicated):

<span style="color:green"> Take a look at </span><span style="color:orange">R/prepare_inflation </span>

### A summary? {-}

To summarize this in an incomplete list:

1. List requirements early
2. Use relative locations
3. Document relevant information

Let's talk about the last point. 
Does that mean that every piece of documentation has to be a mile long?

No.... not necessarily.

But how do I decide what should or should not be included in my documentation? 
Let's make another list:

1. What is *standard* does not have to be documented.
2. What is *easy* needs only little documentation.
3. What is *consistent* only has to be documented once.

Great, now you've already finished the necessary! 
You want to go straight on? 
Let's take a look at the extended goal first.
