# Getting Started {-}

## What is reproducibility? {-}

TBD

## What problems must we solve? {-}

1. copy&paste mistakes
2. inconsistent versions of code or data
3. missing or incompatible software
4. complicated or ambiguous procedure for reproduction

## What concepts must we know about? {-}

1. Dynamic documents
2. Version control
3. Software management
4. Workflow orchestration

## What software must we know about? {-}

1. RMarkdown
2. Git
3. Docker
4. Make

To all of these implementations there are alternatives e.g., Quarto, Jupyter, Singluarity, virtualenv, SnakeMake, and many more.
However, we had to decide on one set of tools.
More important is that you understand for what we use them, than you may replace them with whatever you favor.

## What services will we use? {-}

Normally you work on your local computer.
However, in workshops this often leads to the issues of missing/outdated/broken software setups.
Therefore, we suggest to use the prepared software environment we give you in form of Posit Cloud (= RStudio Cloud).

Additionally, we will make heavy use of GitHub (≠ Git) and
GitHub Actions (∈ GitHub).

## Setup {-}

If you already have an account, than sign in, otherwise, sign up.

### GitHub {-}

If you have no GitHub account:

<https://github.com/signup>

If you already have a GitHub account:

<https://github.com/login>

### Posti/RStudio Cloud {-}

If you have not used Posit/RStudio Cloud before:

Use Option: “Sign Up with GitHub”

<https://login.posit.cloud/register>

If you already have a Posit/RStudio account:

<https://login.posit.cloud/login>

### Final Step {-}

Now, you may open the project:

<https://No-link-to-the-project.yet>

And continue with the [next chapter](./dynamic-documents.html) on the left.
