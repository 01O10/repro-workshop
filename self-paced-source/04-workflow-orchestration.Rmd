```{r results='asis', echo = FALSE}
reprodude2 <- generate_reprodudes(links$reprodudes$five,
                                  "ReproDude",
                                  "Hey, I'm your ReproDude for this chapter. If you have any questions click on me and we can talk!")

## What now? {-}

We have already reached the last chapter of content!
What is it about?

As usual, let's look at our components, which one is missing?

code + data + text + history + software + <span style="color:orange">workflow</span>

Workflow, I heard of that. 
Let's peek again at our problem and softwaresolution lists to be sure.

Problem list:

1. ~~copy&paste mistakes~~
2. ~~inconsistent versions of code or data~~
3. ~~missing or incompatible software~~
4. <span style="color:orange">complicated or ambiguous procedure for reproduction</span>

Software solution list:

1. RMarkdown
2. Git
3. Docker
4. <span style="color:orange">Make</span>

So that means we use Make to avoid the problem of complicated or unclear procedure for reproduction?
Let's jump right in!

## Make? {-}

To understand what make is, let's take a step back. 
To do that, let's move on to a topic that I'm really passionate about. 
Food. And even one step further back, cooking.
What is cooking?

Besides the definition of content, cooking is a sequence of dependencies. 
Let's take a look at my favorite recipe.

>Arrabbiata sauce, or sugo all'arrabbiata in Italian, is a spicy sauce for pasta made from garlic, tomatoes, and dried red chili peppers cooked in olive oil.

And what are the steps in this masterpiece of craftsmanship?
