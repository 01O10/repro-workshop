# Ensuring Reproducibility of complex data analytic projects

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

Can I trust these results \[to reproduce\]? In this workshop (2 x 2h)
participants learn to spot threats to reproducibility and develop the
skills to avoid them. These skills stem from hard learned lessons of the
software engineering community, which developed tools the research
community can utilize. The employed tools, namely RMarkdown, Git, Make,
and Docker, do not merely increase the shelf life of an analysis, they
help researchers to be more productive and collaborate easier.
Researchers who routinely use R will benefit most, however all presented
principles (and most tools) work well with other programming languages.
