### Computer Set Up

- OS: Linux, Mac OS, Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise/Education (no Windows 10 Home)
- Admin Rights
- R + RStudio + Git + Make + Docker installed (you'll get instructions!)
- Having two displays will bring you joy (then you can follow and try out at the same time!).

### Can you answer the following Questions?

- How will two asterisks (`**like this**`) change the formatting in Markdown?
- How do you add an R code chunk to a RMarkdown?
- What is a commit?
- Name a place that is great to host Git repositories.
- How do you open a terminal/shell/cmd on you computer?

If you struggle to answer these questions, it is probably ok to attend the workshop.
However, if you have no idea what I am talking about it will bring you no fun to attend.
