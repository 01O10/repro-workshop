abstract: >
  Computational reproducibility represents a key challenge
  for making one's own work accessible and easily
  understandable for othersâ€”but achieving this goal is not
  easy.

  Often, researchers must invest considerable efforts to
  find out what the end goal of such a reproducible workflow
  can look like and how they can acquire the skills to get
  there.

  This workshop gives an overview of how to create
  reproducible data analyses in R (and beyond).

  Specifically, this workshop will showcase one way to
  automate the entire process from raw data to publishable
  manuscripts in a pre-set online environment.

  This automation combines dynamic document generation (via
  R Markdown), version control (via Git), workflow
  orchestration (via Make) and software management (via
  Docker).

  All these tools and, therefore, the entire automatic
  reproduction of results are available on any machine with
  Docker installed.

  The resulting workflow is hence ensured to reproduce over
  time, locally and in the cloud.
