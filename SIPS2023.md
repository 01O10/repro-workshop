Many researchers want to work reproducibly, but it is not easy.
They must invest considerable time to acquire the knowledge of what is even possible, before getting the skills required for reproducible research.
This workshop gives researchers an overview of how to create reproducible data analyses in R (and beyond). Specifically, researchers will test, in a pre-set online environment, one way to automate the whole process from raw data to publishable manuscripts.
This automation is possible by combining dynamic document generation (via R Markdown), version control (via Git), workflow orchestration (via Make) and software management (via Docker).
These tools and, therefore, automatic reproduction of results are available on any machine with Docker installed.
The resulting workflow is, hence, highly transferable across machines and time.
These core properties of reproducibility are demonstrated for any reader by automatically reproducing the manuscript online via GitHub Actions.

# Hackathon Endproduct

*If your session is a hackathon, what is your end product? Hacks should have a clear “deliverable”—a project or product you are making progress on. If you session is intended as a discussion or brainstorming session, consider submitting it as an unconference instead.*

# Diversity and Inclusion

*How will the session leaders’ content foster diversity & inclusion (e.g., who will present, who will it serve) and how will that improve the science? Note that this response will be used in advertising your session.*

The workshops principle goal is to make research materials more widely available and reusable and thus fosters inclusion and knowledge transfer.
We expect that early career researchers will benefit most from the workshop, however, in the past we got the feedback that even senior researchers (professors, Max Planck directors) found it helpful.
We ourselfs commit to [Berlin Code of Conduct](https://berlincodeofconduct.org) and ask participants to do likewise.

# Pre-requisite

*Please note any pre-requisite knowledge/expertise you will expect from attendees or indicate that no prior experience is needed. This information is very useful for attendees as they decide what to attend, ie., is a session most appropriate for someone who already has experience with a topic or is brand new to it?*

This workshop was successfully completed by researchers who never coded before, however, we expect the most benefit for researchers with the following background:
Participants regularly work with R Studio and are somewhat familiar with R Markdown or Jupyter.
Ideally, they have tried their hand at Git before (whether successful or not does not really matter).


# Theme

*Please classify your session as the theme it fits best in:*

  - [ ] Pedagogy/curriculum/mentoring: content related to educating students
  - [X] Skills: content providing training in particular skills or techniques
  - [ ] Incentives/culture: content related to the incentive structure of science, culture, and norms of science
  - [ ] Logistics/tools: content related to creation or refinement of new tools, databases, and methods
  - [ ] Other

# How would you like to conduct this session?

  - [X] Fully synchronously
  - [ ] Synchronously + ramp-up (e.g., attendees have something to watch ahead of time, hack materials open early, plus a synchronous session)
  - [ ] Fully asynchronously

# If accepted, how long would your session be?

  - [X] 3h
  - [ ] 1.5h
  - [ ] Sonstiges

# Do you have any co-leads for this session?

*This can be a great opportunity to introduce diverse perspectives to the conference and pass on skills to each other. For example, if you are a faculty member, consider inviting a graduate student or post-doc to help you lead the session. If you already have co-leaders in mind, please write their names and e-mails below. The Program Committee also will be happy to help you identify potential co-leaders.*

Elisa Buchberger <buchberger@mpib-berlin.mpg.de>

We welcome suggestions for other co-leaders to broaden the perspective to people without background in methods/neuroimaging and/or with less privilege.



# Time

*What times of day (in Padua time, GMT+1) are you generally able to present/attend if you were to present remotely? (The time zone converter https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/ may be useful). Having more flexible presenting hours will facilitate more global engagement. We will use these time preferences for our online programming and in case in-person presenters have to switch to a remote format.*

anytime

# Zoom

*For virtual sessions: Do you or one of your co-leads have a Zoom pro account that enables you to host meetings longer than 40 minutes? (Note that if you do not, we will be happy to set up the space for you).*

  - [X] Yes, I am able to host my own space
  - [ ] No, I would like to use a SIPS-maintained space
  - [ ] Unsure

# Any other comments about this proposal we should be aware of?

We have plenty experience with synchronous workshops but are thinking about doing some parts self-paced to accommodate more experience levels.
To figure this out we, will give the workshop internally to participants of different experience levels.
Combining synchronous and asynchronous parts would open the possibility for doing this workshop hybrid, if we have another facilitator, to pay appropriate attention to everyone.
